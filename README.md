## Install
We recommend using UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux or MacOS, for the code development. If you are a Windows user, you may refer to [this](docs/install_guidance_windows.md) for a detailed install guide. The following instructions are based on a Linux Ubuntu system, and there could be minor differences for Mac systems.

1. A quick guide for library installation is [here](docs/install_external_libs.md) and a more advanced guide is [there](docs/install-advanced.md). After the libraries are all properly installed, proceed to step 2.

Notice that VTK is typically installed as a shared library in a non-standard folder. One therefore has to edit the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environmental variable for the linker to locate the .so files. Open the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file and edit the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable. See below is an example with my VTK installed at `/Users/juliu/lib/VTK-8.2.0/`.

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/juliu/lib/VTK-8.2.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
For more information on this environmental variable, see [here](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html).

2. After the libraries are installed, add a configuration file named as `system_lib_loading.cmake` in the [conf](conf) folder. You may find a file called `system_lib_loading_example.cmake`, which is an example. In this file, you will have to specify the paths for the external libraries,

 - Set `VTK_DIR` to the VTK library location (e.g. `/home/jliu/lib/VTK-7.1.1-shared`).
 - Set `PETSC_DIR` to the PETSc library location (e.g. `/home/jliu/lib/petsc-3.11.3`).
 - Set `PETSC_ARCH` to the value used in PETSc installation (e.g. `arch-linux2-c-debug`).
 - Set `METIS_DIR` to the METIS library location (e.g. `/home/jliu/lib/metis-5.0.3`).
 - Set `HDF5_DIR` to the HDF5 library location (e.g. `/home/jliu/lib/hdf5-1.8.16`).
 - Set `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` to `$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/mpicc`
 - Set `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to `$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/bin/mpicxx`

After the edit, save the CMake file and rename it as `system_lib_loading.cmake`, and you have your own configuration file set up. Notice that we have the file name `system_lib_loading.cmake` added in .gitignore, meaning that git will not track this file. You may want to keep a copy of this file out of PERIGEE, because when you switch to other branches, PERIGEE may not keep a copy of this file. 

## Build
First, create a folder `build` out of the source directory. Enter that folder, and run the following commands to build, as an example, a suite of heat equation solvers.
```sh
CMake ~/PERIGEE/examples/linearPDE/
```
CMake will print some information on the screen. Pay a look at the variable `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`. If its value is `Debug`, this means your code will be compiled in the debug mode. If you want to make the code faster, run CMake as follows,
```sh
CMake ~/PERIGEE/examples/linearPDE/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
Now the value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to `Release`. The code will be compiled in the optimized mode. For more information about the compiler, please refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48754619/what-are-cmake-build-type-debug-release-relwithdebinfo-and-minsizerel/48755129). Of course, a fully optimized code requires that your external libraries, especially PETSc, are compiled in the optimized mode also. Refer to the [advanced guide](docs/install-advanced.md) for more info on building libraries in a release mode. After CMake generates the Makefile for you, you need to run the following command to compile the source code.
```sh
make
```
Of course, you may add `-j2` to run Makefile with 2 threads. If the make complains about the auto keyword or the nullptr, your default compiler does not support C++11. You may add `SET(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)` in your .cmake configuration file to enforce the C++11 standard. 

## Tutorial
In general, one has to go through the following steps for simulation.
* Obtain the mesh in vtu/vtp format from a front-end code, e.g., SimVascular or Gmsh.
* Run a preprocessor to load the mesh, assign boundary conditions, and partition the mesh. The preprocessor is a *serial* code and may need to be run on a large memory cluster node if you are dealing with a very large problem.
* Run a finite element analysis code to solve the partial differential equations. The solutions will be saved on disk in the binary format.
* Run a preprocessor for postprocessing. This step re-partition the mesh to make preparations for postprocessing, such as visualization, error calculation, etc. Similar to the preprocessor, this routine should be run in *serial* and may consume a lot memory if your mesh is fine. With this routine, we are able to run the postprocessing routine with different number of CPUs. For example, we run FEM analysis with, say, 360 CPUs; visualizing the solution is much less intensive in computing and may only need, say, 24 CPUs. So you should repartition the domain into 24 sub-domains in this step.
* Run a postprocessor in parallel. Often, this step refers to the visualization of the solutions. The visualzation routine will read the binary solution files and write the data into (parallel) vtu/vtp format. Then the data can be visualized in Paraview.

## Simulation Samples
The vortex-induced vibration of an elastic plate with Re $\approx$ 3 $\times$ 10^4. The mesh consists of 18 million linear tetrahedral elements for the fluid and 0.7 million elements for the solid. The variational multiscale formulation provides the LES technique in the flow problem, and the time integration is based on the generalized-&alpha; scheme.

A fluid-structure interaction simulation of a pulmonary model is performed using **the unified continuum and variational multiscale formulation**. The model and mesh are prepared by W. Yang. The solid model is *fully incompressible* and is numerically modeled via the residual-based variational multiscale formulation.
